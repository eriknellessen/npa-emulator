# npa-emulator
The npa emulator is part of the bachelor thesis "Prüfung von öffentlichen eID-Terminals mit einem Android-Smartphone"

It is a partly emulation of the German ID card on an Android device with NFC support to check a terminal and prevent skimming.

The npa emulator contains some modified (to use the protocol PACE for the card and not for the terminal) code from the project [androsmex](https://code.google.com/p/androsmex/). Androsmex is an implementation of the PACE protocol for Android phones.

The current state of the thesis is available as [PDF](docs/bachelorthesis.pdf)
